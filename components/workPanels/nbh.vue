      <p class="description">
        This represents the largest project I was a part of in 2017.
        We built a custom multi-site with a single admin
        for NBH bank and all of its holding branches
        such as Bank Midwest, and Hillcrest Bank.
        This project also focused heavily on ensuring that accesibility was front
        of mind when building out the navigation, components, and other interactive elements.
