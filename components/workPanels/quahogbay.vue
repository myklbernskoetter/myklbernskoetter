        The Quahog Bay Conservancy is a non-profit operating in Maine.  Their goal is to not only clean up
        the Quahog Bay, but to educate boaters, and recreational users of their local waters on the effects
        of pollution. In 2015 they approached 40Digits about creating an informational site that would help them achieve these goals.

        After a year of building html emails, this was my first break into full WordPress development. I'm proud that it's still going strong
        and expanding as the Conservancy grows and expands its projects and deepens it's impact on the local Bay area.
